**Introduction**

PLL-Phase Locked Loop
A phased-locked loop or phase lock loop (PLL) is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input signal. There are several different types; the simplest is an electronic circuit consisting of a variable frequency oscillator and a phase detector in a feedback loop. The oscillator generates a periodic signal, and the phase detector compares the phase of that signal with the phase of input periodic signal, adjusting the oscillator to keep the phase matched.

Clock Multiplier: It multiplies frequency of clock signal. It is used in processors for operation.

**EDA Tools:**

esim : Developed by IIT Bombay. It is used to create spice netlists.

ngspice : Open source tool for circuit simulator

Magic : Layout editor for designing layouts and generating spice netlists from it.
